# BunnyProject

Starts by creating and sorting an array of bunnies by age.

Option is given at start to run in realtime as per 1* or to have option to cull and have no max as per 2*

1st iterator prints all bunnies, removes dead bunnies, ages bunnies and updates values for making new bunnies, killing bunnies, and infecting bunnies.

After iterator bunnies are born, dead bunnies are printed.

Bunnies are also made infected in an iterator

Once this has been completed process loops unless there are no bunnies in list.
