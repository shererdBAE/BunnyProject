# BunnyProject

Starts by creating an instance of bunnymanager called bunnyman.

List of bunnies is made by creating and sorting an array of bunnies by age.

Functions are called to process bunnies.

Once this has been completed process loops unless there are no bunnies in list.

Parameters for spec such as age bunnies die and percetage chance for being infected can be easily changed in bunnymanager.h and bunny.h
